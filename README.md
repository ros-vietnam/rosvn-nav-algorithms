# ROS Vietnam – Navigation & Motion Planning Algorithms  
`rosvn-nav-algorithms`

> **A research-grade, simulation-first repository for mobile robot navigation and motion planning algorithms in ROS 2.**

---

## 1. Overview

**ROS Vietnam Navigation & Motion Planning Algorithms** is the official algorithmic repository of the **ROS Vietnam** community dedicated to **robot navigation research, evaluation, and open collaboration**.

This repository focuses on:
- Classical navigation algorithms
- Modern optimization-based planners
- Learning-assisted navigation (where applicable)
- Fair comparison under standardized simulation conditions

All algorithms in this repository are developed and evaluated using the **ROS Vietnam Simulation Foundation**.

## 2. Philosophy

This repository is built on four core principles:

### 2.1 Algorithm First
- No hardware dependency
- No vendor lock-in
- Clean algorithmic abstractions

### 2.2 Reproducibility
- Deterministic experiments
- Controlled randomness
- Explicit metrics

### 2.3 Comparability
- Same robots
- Same worlds
- Same sensor models
- Same evaluation pipeline

### 2.4 Academic Integrity
- Proper citation
- Transparent assumptions
- No hidden heuristics

> *A navigation algorithm is only as good as the benchmark that evaluates it.*
